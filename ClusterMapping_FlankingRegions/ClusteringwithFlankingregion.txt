1.ClusterMapping.R: will generate The GenomeFlankingRegions
2.buildindex.sh: build index files for all reference genomes
3.removefirstlines.sh: remove the first line of all the files in GenomeFlankingRegions
3.runmain.sh: for each genome(as reference) it will run the script FlankAlignment.sh
4.FlankAlignment.sh: Does the pairwise alignment of the refrerence genome's Flanking region to all other genomes as query

5. function genomeDistance() in ClusterMapping.R will read all the pairwise alignments, then maps clusters of each pair of genomes. (a cluster will be mapped to another cluster if it is in its tight anchor(flanking region))

Distance between two genomes G1 and G2 =  (number of clusters in G1 which has a cluster anchor in G2) 
                                        + (number of clusters in G2 which has a cluster anchor in G1)
