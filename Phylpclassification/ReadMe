Install the requirements for tsfm: https://github.com/tlawrence3/tsfm/blob/master/requirements.txt
Install tsfm using this command: 
sudo apt install python3-pip
pip3 install tsfm
Install covea-2.4.4 (rename the getline function in file sqio.c to my_getline)


run the fallowing scripts:
A) remove_intron_Variablearm.R: Remove introns and variable arm
1. precprocessing (Limits for genes used): a) intersection of TSE and ARA. b) nonpseudo by both tse and ara. c) have 4 arms or 5 (including variable arm)  
2. Keep the Aminoacid class as the last part of gene ID and Mark initiators).  
3. Remove the introns and variable arms and save the result in file Integrated_Genes_NoVarIntron.fasta 

B) Run covea with the fallowing command: 
covea TRNA2-euk.cm Integrated_Genes_NoVarIntron.fasta > Trytryp_genes_NoVarIntron.covea

C) coveaProcessing.R: Editing the Trytryp_genes_NoVarIntron.covea file
1. reading the aligned sequences in "seqDB" dataframe and secondary structures in "SSDB" and saving them in files: coveaDF.txt and coveaDF_SS.txt. Also, save the CS line in struct_file.txt
2. Removing sites that have more than 99% gap (removing rows in seqDB dataframe that have more than 99% ".")
3. Removing genes that have more than 8 gaps in their aligned sequence
4. Save the Edited covea file in EditedCovea.covea file. Also as a fasta file (with "."s replaced with "-") in EditedCovea.fasta to be converted to clustal format for tsfm
5. Split the EditedCovea.fasta based on their Amoinoacid class and convert the splited files to clustalW format using fasgrep in splitFuncClass.sh script

Run tsfm with the fallowing command:

export PATH="~/.local/bin:$PATH"
tsfm --logo -c /home/fatemeh/Leishmania_Aug2018/phyloclassification/tsfminput/struct_file.txt /home/fatemeh/Leishmania_Aug2018/phyloclassification/tsfminput/clustalW/TryTryp
